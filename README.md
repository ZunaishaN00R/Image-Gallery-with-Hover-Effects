# Image Gallery with Hover Effects

This repository contains the source code for an image gallery created using HTML and CSS. The gallery features image thumbnails with opacity effects applied on hover.

## Description:

- **HTML Code**: The `index.html` file contains the structure of the image gallery. Images are displayed using `img` tags inside `div` elements with the class `gallery-item`. Each `img` tag has a `src` attribute pointing to the respective image file and an `alt` attribute providing alternative text for accessibility.

- **CSS Code**: The styling for the image gallery is defined in the `biet-f21-049.css` file. The gallery is arranged using flexbox, with each image thumbnail positioned using relative positioning. Hover effects are implemented using CSS transitions. When hovering over a thumbnail (`gallery-item`), the image inside it (`img`) reduces its opacity to 0.7, providing a visual indication of interaction. Additionally, the thumbnail enlarges slightly (scale of 1.05) on hover, creating a subtle zoom effect.

## Usage:

To view the image gallery, open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that the `biet-f21-049.css` file is in the same directory as the HTML file to apply the necessary styles.
